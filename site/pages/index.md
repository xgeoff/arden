## Ardan Language

**Ardan** is a constructed, phonetic language designed for clarity, expressiveness, and ease of use. It is built from the ground up with a logical grammar, elegant morphology, and a streamlined writing system that avoids redundancy and ambiguity. Ardan draws inspiration from natural languages but emphasizes simplicity and regularity throughout its structure.

### ✨ Key Features

* **Alphabet & Phonetics**: Uses the standard English alphabet with unambiguous sound-to-letter mappings. No duplicate sounds, diacritics, or special characters.
* **Writing System**: Fully phonetic and visually clean, following standard punctuation and capitalization rules. Unique mechanisms like `?Question?` and `!Exclamation!` mark sentence tone clearly.
* **Grammar**:

* Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order.
* Noun cases: nominative (-a), accusative (-am), genitive (-um); plurals end in **-ee**.
* Verb tenses: present (root), past (-o), future (-bo); verbs are not conjugated by gender or number.
* Pronouns are gender-neutral and consistent across personal and possessive forms.
* **Adjectives**: Always end in **-el**, come after the noun, and are fully gender-neutral. Comparative and superlative forms use `-ar` and `-estel`, or the helper words *mor* and *seel*.
* **No Apostrophes**: Possessives are handled using **de** or **yun** (e.g., *book de child* = "the child’s book").
* **Minimal Word Stress**: All syllables are pronounced with equal emphasis, making pronunciation consistent and predictable.
* **Intonation**: Built-in rules for expressive sentence types, including questions, exclamations, and emphatics.
* **Expandable**: Ardan is designed to be modular and extensible, suitable for storytelling, linguistic experimentation, or practical use.
