### **üìò Arden Adverb Formation Principles**

In Arden:

* **Adverbs follow the verb** directly (per your adjective/adverb rules)

* Many adverbs are formed from:

  * **Adjective root \+ position** (e.g., *quick* ‚Üí *quickly*)

  * Or via dedicated roots (especially for time/frequency/logical concepts)

* We'll assign unique roots when needed ‚Äî not just mechanically derived
